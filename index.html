  <p><i>Ao Oni</i> is a Japanese RPG Maker game developed by noprops and was first released in November 2008. While the viduals
    of the game are not anything to be impressed by and it posses a very simple storyline, the game gained a large following due
    to it's horror aspects. Although, most of the credit goes to to the chase music which effectively brings a chilling atmosphere.</p>

   <p>The story follows Hiroshi and his classmates as he enters a deserted mansion that is rumored to be haunted. Things go wrong
     when a mysterious creature appears and the only door leading to the exit doesn't work. Control Hiroshi to learn about the 
     mysterious mansion as you solve a variety of puzzles. Just be wary of the creature....</p>

   <p>The game opens to show Hiroshi, Takuro, Mika, and Takeshi standing in front of the large mansion. Not long after entering the mansion, the 
     group hears something break in another room. Hiroshi volunteers to investigate and noticed that a plate had simply shattered. Feeling 
     reaasured that nothing was wrong, he goes back to reunite with his classmates, only to notice that they weren't there anymore.

<br> </br>
     From this point and onward, the player will be required to move Hiroshi around the mansion and beyond while solving puzzles to find an exit. 
     Hence, the player moves Hiroshi down a hallway and there will be a mysterious shadow that walks acorss a door and inside a room. At that 
     moment, this sound begins to play.
<br> </br>
<audio controls>
<source src="first.encounter.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br> </br>
     This will be the only time the sound is played. However at this moment, these 16 minutes of sound, plus many others from this game gives the 
     player, as Massumi has stated, a physical feeling before the player can recognize it as an emotion. With that, we come across another sound. 
     Please listen to this one carefully as it is the sound that <i>Ao Oni</i> is truly known for.
<br> </br>
<audio controls>
<source src="ao.oni.theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br> </br>
     This is what the player hears when the oni finally shows itself and chases Hiroshi.
<br> </br>

<br> </br>
     There is no method for knowing when the blue creature will appear. Some moments are scripted, but most of the appearences are random and this 
     music plays exactly as the oni appears. The game is a perfect example for Massumi's statements because at times there is almost no time to 
     process that a chase is happening. The player is often deeply focused and distracted by walking across maps and attempting to solve puzzles, 
     but out of nowhere, the creater appears and begins walking towards Hiroshi with this music playing simultaneously. The player can react 
     quickly and hopefully either hide or run a far enough distance as a means of excape. In any case, there will always be that initial physical 
     response to this terrifying music before the player can fully have that emotional response of fear and surprise.</p>

  <p>Compared to the image of the default oni on the left, there are many other creatures that make appearences as well as other sounds woth 
     noting. The next sound being Mika's scream as heard below.

     Hiroshi rushes over to where he found Mika before and sees that the creature has started to eat her. The blue oni chases Hiroshi right after 
     until he successfully runs away. As the player continues the game while solving different puzzles, they soon discover that when someone is 
     eaten, they are also turned into one of the creatures.

     Hiroshi soon discovers that Takeshi also turns into an oni. All the while Mika and Takeshi were classmates of Hiroshi, they also come after 
     the player. Luckily, escaping them is done the same way as the default creature.

   <p>I believe it is important to mention some of the background music that can be heard while it rains and when the player arrives at specific 
     maps.
<br> </br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="rain.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br> </br>
     This rain sound plays when the player is in rooms or hallways where windows are located. It is one of the calmer sounds heard throughout the 
     game. It both brings a sense of tranquility and anxiousness. On the other hand, this breathing sound below is quite creepy and it can feels 
     as though someone is breathing against your neck. The music is heard when the start screen is shown and when Hiroshi walks around the basement
     map.
<br> </br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="breathing.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<br> </br>
     The player soon begins to reach the end of the game and finds the last of Hiroshi's classmates and the only other survivor, Takuro. He is 
     found hiding and explains that he had twisted his ankle while asking Hiroshi to walk around while he rests. Hiroshi then continues to solve 
     a few more puzzles until he finds a rope ladder that leads towards an exit. The player walks back towards Takuro and he joins the party. Once 
     they both reach the rope ladder, they discover that the creature has eaten it. Hiroshi and Takuro run away when the oni spots them, but Takuro 
     falls and allows Hiroshi to escape without him. Takuro disappears and isn't seen again. Although, there is a moment when Hiroshi enters the 
     map of the Old Building, where this unique oni appears. 
<br> </br>
<img src="fwatty.jpg">
<br> </br>
     This oni is known to walk normally for a few seconds before speading past. The same chase music plays during the chase scene, but it is much 
     harder to avoid being caught. After the player has many tries and solves the last remaining puzzles, Takuro suddenly appears behind the player 
     while asking to join. Hiroshi, surpised to see his friend is still alive, allows him to join the party. The player solves the remaining puzzle 
     but....
<br> </br>
<img src="friend1.jpg">
<br> </br>
     Takuro shows himself as an oni. The player has to avoid him and finally, reach the door that leads towards the outdoors. Even tho Takuro as an 
     oni chases after the player, Hiroshi manages to escape. Hiroshi explains that he never once looked back after running and refused to tell 
     others about what occured.</p>

   <p>During my childhood, I greatly appreciated indie RPG Maker games and often played them. I decided to revisit
     <i>Ao Oni</i> for the purpose of this project. It is a short playthrough that took me about five hours to complete.
     Although there were many times where I jumped in my seat, I enjoyed every moment of this game. My favorite aspects 
     will always be when the creature appears at random and the music that follows. The popularity of <i>Ao Oni</i> has 
     grown so much so that there are now movie adaptations as well as a light novel series and manga. The indie RPG Maker 
   games community was quite small, but <i>Ao Oni</i> truly brought the attention to the community to those who had yet 
   to explore it. Thus, more RPG Maker games were created following <i>Ao Oni</i>'s success.</p>
