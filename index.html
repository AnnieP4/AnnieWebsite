<html><title>Ao Oni and it's Terrifying Music</title><head></head>
<body>
<br>This is where I will be talking about the horrifying sound effects used in the game Ao Oni, a Japanese RPG first released November 2008.</br>
<br>I played this game during my childhood and I intend to play it again to remember some of the events within the story.<br>
<br>Luckily, it is a short playthrough.<br>
<br>I have always been a fan of Japanese indie games because it is what I grew up with.<br>
<br>One thing I will never forget is the intense music while one is being chased by the blue demon.<br>
<br>Although the visual design of the game may not be the best, I believe it is the sound effects that help add that touch of horror to this game and why it has become so popular.>
