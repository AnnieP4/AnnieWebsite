<html><title>Ao Oni and it's Terrifying Music</title><head></head>
<body>
<br>This is where I will be talking about the horrifying sound effects used in the game Ao Oni, a Japanese RPG first released November 2008.</br>
<br>I played this game during my childhood and I intend to play it again to remember some of the events within the story.</br>
<br>Luckily, it is a short playthrough.</br>

<br>I have always been a fan of Japanese indie games because it is what I grew up with.</br>
<br>One thing I will never forget is the intense music while one is being chased by the blue demon.</br>
<br>Although the visual design of the game may not be the best, I believe it is the sound effects that help add that touch of horror to this game and why it has become so popular.</br>

<br> Bullet points:
  - developed by "noprops" and first released in November 2008
  - engine is RPG Maker
  - gained a large folowing and later adapted into variety of medie including: 2 movies, light novel series, and a manga
  - PLOT SUMMARY: Hiroshi and his classmates investigate a deserted mansion that it rumored to be haunted. They discover a mysterious 
    creature who attcks them. If one of Hiroshi's friends dies, then they also transform into an oni and give chase.
  -GAMEPLAY: control Hiroshi to explore the mansion, you need to continue solving multiple puzzles to escape, the Ao Oni will chase at both
    scripted and at random times, you must outrun him or hide to avoid being killed
  -RECEPTION: the game become popular thanks to the horror aspects despite being a simple game with a simple story, the background
    music is thought to be a key contributor to the chilling atmosphere, same could be said about the unscripted moments when the 
    creature comes out.
