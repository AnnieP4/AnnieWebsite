  <p><i>Ao Oni</i> is a Japanese RPG Maker game developed by noprops and was first released in November 2008. While the viduals and 
    graphics of the game are not anything to be impressed by, the game gained a large following due to it's horror aspects. 
    Although, most of the credit goes to to the chase music which effectively brings a chilling atmosphere.</p>
</div> 

<br> </br>

<p style="color:white;">In Japanese, ao (青) means blue and oni (鬼) is a demonic creature often depicted to be large with a fearful appearence!</p>

<br> </br>

<div>
   <p>The game follows a very simple story where Hiroshi, Takuro, Mika, and Takeshi enter a deserted mansion that is rumored 
     to be haunted.

     It doesn't take long for things to go wrong when a mysterious creature begins to attack them. If one of 
     them is killed, then they will also turn into one of the creatures. Control Hiroshi and explore the mansion where you 
     will need to solve various puzzles to find an escape route. Be vary cautious of the creature as it will chase you at both
     scripted and random times. Outrun him, hide, or get captured.</p>

   <p>During my childhood, I greatly appreciated indie RPG Maker games and often played them. I decided to revisit
     <i>Ao Oni</i> for the purpose of this project. It is a short playthrough that took me about five hours to complete.
     Although there were many times where I jumped in my seat, I enjoyed every moment of this game. My favorite aspects 
     will always be when the creature appears at random and the music that follows. The popularity of <i>Ao Oni</i> has 
     grown so much so that there are now movie adaptations as well as a light novel series and manga.</p>
