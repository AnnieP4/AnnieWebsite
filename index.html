  <p><i>Ao Oni</i> is a Japanese RPG Maker game developed by noprops and was first released in November 2008. While the viduals
    of the game are not anything to be impressed by and it posses a very simple storyline, the game gained a large following due
    to it's horror aspects. Although, most of the credit goes to to the chase music which effectively brings a chilling atmosphere.</p>

////////describe the narrative arc of the game
  -CHARACTERS: Ao Oni, Hiroshi, Takuro, Mika, Takeshi, Fuatty/Blockman Oni
  -  If one of them is killed, then they will also turn into one of the creatures. Be vary cautious of the creature as it will chase you at both
     scripted and random times. Outrun him, hide, or get captured.


<br> </br>

<div>
   <p>The game opens to show Hiroshi, Takuro, Mika, and Takeshi standing in front of the large mansion. Not long after entering the mansion, the 
     group hears something break in another room. Hiroshi volunteers to investigate and noticed that a plate had simply shattered. Feeling 
     reaasured that nothing was wrong, he goes back to reunite with his classmates, only to notice that they weren't there anymore.

Takuro <img src="takuro.png">
     <br>
Mika <img src="mika.png">
     <br>
Takeshi <img src="takeshi.png">
     <br>
     From this point and onward, the player will be required to move Hiroshi around the mansion and beyond while solving puzzles to find an exit. 
     Hence, the player moves Hiroshi down a hallway and there will be a mysterious shadow that walks acorss a door and inside a room. At that 
     moment, this sound begins to play.
     <br>
<audio controls>

</audio>
     <br>
     This will be the only time the sound is played. However at this moment, these 16 minutes of sound, plus many others from this game gives the 
     player, as Massumi has stated, a physical feeling before the player can recognize it as an emotion. With that, we come across another sound. 
     Please listen to this one carefully as it is the sound that <i>Ao Oni</i> is truly known for.
     <br>
<audio controls>
<source src="ao.oni.theme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

     <br>
     This is what the player hears when the oni finally shows itself and chases Hiroshi.
     <br>
<img src="gameplay.chase.jpg">
     <br>
     There is no method for knowing when the blue creature will appear. Some moments are scripted, but most of the appearences are random and this 
     music plays exactly as the oni appears. The game is a perfect example for Massumi's statements because at times there is almost no time to 
     process that a chase is happening. The player is often deeply focused and distracted by walking across maps and attempting to solve puzzles, 
     but out of nowhere, the creater appears and begins walking towards Hiroshi with this music playing simultaneously. The player can react 
     quickly and hopefully either hide or run a far enough distance as a means of excape. In any case, there will always be that initial physical 
     response to this terrifying music before the player can fully have that emotional response of fear and surprise.</p>

<br> </br>

<div>
   <p>During my childhood, I greatly appreciated indie RPG Maker games and often played them. I decided to revisit
     <i>Ao Oni</i> for the purpose of this project. It is a short playthrough that took me about five hours to complete.
     Although there were many times where I jumped in my seat, I enjoyed every moment of this game. My favorite aspects 
     will always be when the creature appears at random and the music that follows. The popularity of <i>Ao Oni</i> has 
     grown so much so that there are now movie adaptations as well as a light novel series and manga.</p>
